# What is Basil?

Basil is a library for building data models in Haskell. It provides a way to
encode ER models in Haskell at both the value- and the type-level. This
enforces a number of constraints.

Using the ER model, Basil can generate an in-memory database or an interface to
a relational database.

## Current state

The code is very much in alpha state.

## Examples

Have a look at Example3.lhs, it is the most recent example.
